      have been there for them. \n\nWith their connections, they managed to find
      you a new job, in addition to giving you glowing praise and referrals to their
      contacts. \n\nThey are probably the best thing you've taken away from this
      soul-draining job."

      course of the both of you working together. \n\nThey understand that you had
      your hands tied in some situations, but there are no hard feelings and wishes
      you the best on your future endeavours. \n\nPerhaps you'll get to work with
      them again someday."

      two weren't exactly close before, but perhaps they hold a grudge against you.
      \n\nThere is no way to tell without confronting them, and they does not seem
      to be actively sabotaging you, so it's probably best to let sleeping dogs lie."

      terms with them, but they definitely have been spreading the word to stay away
      from you and whatever company you choose to work with in the future."
