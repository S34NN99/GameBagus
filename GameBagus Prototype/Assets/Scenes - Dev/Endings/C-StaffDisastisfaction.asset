      leave the company, despite you staying with them til the bitter end. If there
      was a bus, you bet you were thrown under it. \n\nSeems that you made some very,
      very powerful enemies, but at the very least, you might be able to sue them
      for their shenanigans."

      you've pulled while working here, and some even openly blame you for the terrible
      state the company is in now. \n\nWhile you manage to get out relatively unscathed,
      you probably shouldn't use them as a reference in your future job."

      and kiss-assery, and that earned you a little cushioning when the backlash
      hit. \n\nThey see your value in their future ventures, or, perhaps, simply
      as an obedient lackey that's nice to have around. "

      to the whims and fancies of those at the top of the food chain. \n\nYou're
      not sure if the things you have done to earn your place here were moral or
      just, but you got a nice little golden parachute of your own as your severance
      package. \n\nWas it worth it?"
